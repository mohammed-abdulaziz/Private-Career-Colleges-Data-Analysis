  Private career colleges (PCCs) play an important role in Ontario's postsecondary education system. They offer diploma and certificate programs that teach students practical skills to join the workforce. As an alternative to publicly funded universities and colleges, PCCs focus on shorter, job-oriented vocational training in fields such as healthcare, human resources, technology, truck driving, business, etc. However, the effectiveness of these colleges needs examination. We should analyze the impact of PCCs on their graduates’ career success and financial stability. To that end, I selected the Private Career Colleges (PCC) key performance indicators - 2022 dataset from the Government of Ontario Open Data Portal. This dataset includes metrics such as graduation rates, graduate employment rates within their field of study, and graduate satisfaction levels. I will aim to study the relationships between these factors to identify meaningful insights. For instance, I will examine whether higher employment rates are linked to greater satisfaction. I also want to explore whether the program type studied affects graduates’ satisfaction levels or their employment rates.
